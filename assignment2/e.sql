-- (e) big documents Write a SQL statement to find all documents that have more than 300 total terms, including duplicate terms. (Hint: You can use the HAVING clause, or you can use a nested query. Another hint: Remember that the count column contains the term frequencies, and you want to consider duplicates.) (docid, term_count)
select count(*) from (select docid,sum(count) from frequency group by docid having sum(count) > 300 );
